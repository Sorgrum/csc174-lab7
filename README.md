Description of information architecture:

### Ontology:
The three students whose data is used for this lab are 
Lingling Li 
Valerie Tam
Kevin Kao

The heading is "Odd student Out". Each student's section follows the same outline. The first component is the student's name followed by their picture. This is followed by a short description and at the end it the link to the original website of the student. 

In the subpage, the outline is similar for each student. The name and picture come first. Then there are three sub-headings for each student. The subheadings are not consistent because each student wrote it separately and they do not match. However, the style and content are similar in design (a subheading with one or two paragraphs of content).



### Taxonomy: 
The index and the subpage are both divided into header, article and footer sections. 
The header contains just the title for the pages.
The article contains the bulk of the page. The article is furthur divided into three sections, one for each student, for both index and the subpage. Each section is outlined differently for index and the subpage.

For the index, each section contains the student's name in header tag, followed by the figure tag (containing the photo), a paragraph of text in <p> tag, and a link to the original website in an <a> tag.

Fof the subpage, each section contains the student's name, image, subheadings with content in <h3> and <p> tags respectively.
The footer is empty for now but will be modified with content later on.



### Choreography 

The students are arranged in alphabetical order of their first name. The subpage follows the order of details in the chronological order that would follow if it was told in the form of a story.
